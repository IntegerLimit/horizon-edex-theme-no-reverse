## Horizon eDEX-UI Theme Fork

This fork provides three different types, for each theme (`horizon-disrupted` and `horizon-full`).
The three types are:
- `-no-shell-reverse`. This makes it so the shells are no longer reversed, and go from left to right, **instead of** right to left.
- `-no-memory-reverse`. This makes it so that the active memory slots are highlighted with green, and free slots highlighted with dark blue, **instead of** the other way around.
- `-no-reverse`. This has both of the above changes.

Horizon is a modern, sexy and colorful theme for [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui).

To install it, download the `fonts` and `themes` folders of this repo and put them in your [eDEX config directory](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/wiki/userData).

Then, launch eDEX, use `Ctrl+Shift+S` (or `âŒ˜+Shift+S`) to open the settings, select your chosen theme (`horizon-disputed` or its versions, or `horizon-full` or its versions) in the "theme" dropdown menu, hit "Save to Disk" and "Reload UI". Done!

The `-full` variant has no on-screen keyboard and a larger terminal. Screenshots below.

*Note: In this theme, the visual order of terminal tabs is reversed (unless using `-no-shell-reverse` or `-no-reverse` versions), and the memory monitor emphasizes free memory slots instead of used ones (unless using `-no-memory-reverse` or `-no-reverse` versions).*
